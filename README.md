# scdl - a simple SoundCloud downloader
You run it, give it a track link or a playlist link and it gets downloaded. It's as simple as that.

Requires modules to work! `pip install requests` ` pip install mutagen`

Warning: If a track says “NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR COUNTRY”, then this tool can’t download the track without a VPN/Proxy/whatever and I can’t change that. Use said tools to get around this.
